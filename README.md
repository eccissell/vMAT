Code and data files for the analysis of the coral reef cyanobacterial mat virome (including the complete vMAT database) presented in  Cissell and McCoy (2023) Top-heavy trophic structure within benthic viral dark matter. Environmental Microbiology, 25(11), 2303-2320. Available from: https://doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.16457. 

The vMAT database is provided in both .fa and .faa (from Prodigal -p meta) formats.


Code files include:

- A combined R script used in the statistical analysis of all data and for generating plots (.R)
- The code for the bioinformatic analysis of the sequencing data (.txt)

Data files include:

- Datset S1 which provides descriptive information for every recovered viral vOTU in the vMAT database (.tsv)
- Sequence files for all viral sequences in the vMAT database (.fa and .faa)
